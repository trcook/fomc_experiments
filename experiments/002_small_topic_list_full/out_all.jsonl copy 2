No longer do our largest banks simply take in deposit funds and lend out the money to borrowers.  Currently, well over $200 billion in assets that, in times past, have resided on the books of banks, now are owned by remote securitization conduits sponsored by banks.  Sponsorship of securitization, which is now almost solely a large bank phenomenon, holds the potential for completely transforming the traditional paradigm of \"banking.\"  Now, loans are made directly by the conduits, or are made by the banks and then immediately sold to the conduits.  To finance the origination or purchase of the loans, a conduit issues several classes of asset-backed securities collateralized by the loans.  Most of the conduit's debt is issued to investors who require that the senior securities be highly rated, generally double-A and triple-A.  In order to achieve these ratings, the conduit obtains credit enhancements insulating the senior security holders from defaults on the underlying loans.  Generally, it is the bank sponsor that provides these credit enhancements, which can be in the form of standby letters of credit to the conduit, or via the purchase of the most junior/subordinated securities issued by the conduit.  In return for providing the credit protection, as well as the loan origination and servicing functions, the bank lays claim to all residual spreads between the yields on the loans and the interest and non-interest cost of the conduit's securities, net of any loan losses.

In this approach, banks can choose their own capital allocations, but would be sanctioned heavily if cumulative trading losses during a quarter were to exceed their chosen capital allocations.

For example, the banking agencies have announced programs to place an increased emphasis on banks' internal risk measurement and management processes within the assessment of overall management quality that is, how well a bank employs modern technology to manage risk will be reflected in the \"M\" portion of the bank's CAMEL rating.

The improvement in productivity growth must be this large because higher productivity raises future benefits as well as current and future tax receipts. However, given that we struggle to devise economic policies that might raise productivity growth by a few tenths of a percentage point per annum, a gain of 2 full points seems beyond the reach of credibility."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

Simply put, unless social security taxes increase, or as I just indicated, more likely, benefits are adjusted, domestic savings must increase. Potential beneficiaries must further abstain from consuming all of their incomes.  Enough must be set aside over a lifetime of work to fund the excess of consumption over any non-social security income a retiree may still enjoy.  At the simplest level, one could envision households saving by actually storing goods purchased during their working years for consumption during retirement.  Even better, the resources that would have otherwise gone into the stored goods could be diverted to the production of new capital assets, which would, cumulatively, over a working lifetime, produce an even greater quantity of retirement goods and services.  In short, we would be getting more output per worker, our traditional measure of productivity, and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

As I argued at length in the Social Security Commission deliberations of 1983, with only marginal effect, some delaying of the age of eligibility for retirement benefits will become increasingly pressing.  For example, adjusting the full-benefits retirement age to keep pace with increases in life expectancy would keep the ratio of retirement years to expected lifespan approximately constant and would help to significantly narrow the funding gap. Hopefully, other modifications to social security benefits also will be judged as necessary.  Moreover, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the Consumer Price Index overstates increases in the cost of living, and thus indexing social security benefits to the CPI goes far beyond the intent of the Congress to insulate retirees from inflation.  In that regard, the recently released report from the Boskin commission makes a valuable contribution to the emerging consensus on this issue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

This reduced the reserve base and the ability of the fledgling American banking system to expand credit.

In the small-value sector, ACH payments have also grown rapidly, although from a very low base.  An important issue is how fast electronic payments will grow in the near-to-medium term and whether they will begin to replace the check as one of the major payment instruments in the retail sector.

These characteristics greatly speed up the final transfer of funds and the successful completion of settlement.  The result is that the duration of interbank risk exposures, typically overnight exposures in check clearinghouses, is shortened significantly.  Over the past few years, these risk reduction benefits have helped increase interest in the Federal Reserve's national same-day settlement service."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees.

Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary for us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers.  It is also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net is that it creates or augments incentives for some banks to take additional risks.

On the other hand, we must strike a balance and not make the firewalls so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergies between the banks and their affiliates.

This is why judgment has been, and will continue to be, a critical component of prudential supervision.  However, the technology and techniques banks have developed, and are developing, allow us greatly to improve that judgment by constructing measures of soundness in probability terms.  If we can obtain reasonable estimates of portfolio loss distributions, soundness can be defined, for example, as the probability of losses exceeding capital.  In other words, soundness can be defined in terms of a quantifiable insolvency probability.  Moreover, one can conceive of definitions of soundness that go beyond simply the probability of insolvency to encompass also the level and variability of losses to a deposit insurance fund in the event of insolvency.  All of these approaches, however, require the regulators to establish targets regarding acceptable failure rates or an insurance fund's exposure to potential losses.

To ease those constraints, the savings and loan industry was allowed to offer a 50-basis-point premium over commercial banks to attract deposits.  But even this proved insufficient as the problem of housing access was hindered by the outmoded Depression Era delivery system of finance.   In 1967, which was otherwise a boom year for the U.S. economy, real residential investment ran 14 percent below its 1964 pace.  And for the entire period of the late 1960s, housing starts ran almost one-third below their 1959 peak.  Needless to say, this combination of social and economic forces created political pressure for change that became irresistible, and the Great Society cycle began.  In 1968 Congress allowed the FHA to adjust the ceiling mortgage rate above the statutory rate.  It also authorized section 235, allowing HUD to provide mortgage assistance to allow the interest rate paid by the buyer to be as low as 1 percent and the downpayment to be as low as $200.  For all intents and purposes, a flood of essentially free money began pouring into the housing market.  This rapid political response and flood of government money created problems of its own.  By December 1970, the natural abuses of section 235 became apparent.  A report to the House Banking Committee concluded, \"The Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Federal Housing Administration may be well on its way toward insuring itself into a national housing scandal... FHA has allowed real estate speculation of the worst type to go on.\"  Substandard homes bearing inflated mortgages coupled with the practice of \"flipping\" by unscrupulous speculators was the natural result of this virtually free access to funds.

At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.  This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.  Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability. Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

Specifically, employing disaggregated data from the national income and product accounts, this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in the service sector is implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained.  Indeed, the published data indicate that the level of output per hour in a number of service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades.

The quantification of credit risks, by far the most important risk in banking, may be a candidate.  At present, some institutions are making significant strides on a number of fronts to better quantify and manage credit risk.  In addition to major developments in credit scoring and the use of artificial intelligence in underwriting various types of consumer loans, a few banks are beginning to use historical data to estimate probability loss distributions for the credit risk of different quality commercial loans.  In some banks, credit risk adjusted returns to capital are being used to construct a portfolio management framework for credit risk.  This, in turn, is providing a proving ground for a risk-adjusted pricing of loans as well as a myriad of new instruments such as credit derivatives.  While industry efforts to quantify credit risks are still in the early stages of evolution, recent progress holds promise for reducing both institutional and systemic risks. Indeed, these efforts might eventually lead to new supervisory regimes for addressing credit risk.  Better methods of quantifying credit risk have significant potential for reducing the time examiners spend in on-site examinations.  Moreover, advances in credit risk measurement may ultimately allow supervisors to design regulatory capital standards around internal models.  We recognize the inadequacy of the existing risk-based capital regime where such assets as loans are all treated as having the same risk.  We are actively encouraging the development of more quantitative approaches to credit risk management.  However, better regulatory tools are not yet available.  While supervisors can prod developments in risk management, ultimately it will be up to the industry to find other ways to better measure and manage credit risk.

Investors have an obvious interest in being able to make meaningful assessments of a firm's performance, underlying trends, and income-producing potential.  Sound, well-managed firms can benefit if better disclosure enables them to obtain funds at risk premiums that accurately reflect  lower risk profiles. Inadequate financial disclosures, on the other hand, could penalize well-managed firms if market participants are unable to assess fundamental financial strength."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

Everyone agrees that a critical function of financial statements is to reflect in a meaningful way underlying trends in the financial performance and condition of the firm as well as the economic substance of its activities.  However, the Board believes that the application of market value accounting to business strategies where not appropriate, and particularly when applied on a piecemeal basis, or when market prices are not readily available, may lead to increased volatility or fluctuation in reported results.  Such accounting practices may actually obscure underlying trends or developments affecting a firm's condition and performance.  Requiring companies to adopt market value accounting where it is not consistent with business strategies can cause them to incur significant costs to provide information that may not realisticly reflect way underlying circumstances or trends in performance.  Moreover, from the standpoint of financial statement analysts and other users, having to make adjustments to remove the effects of meaningless accounting volatility from income statements and balance sheets can also impose significant costs without offsetting benefits.

That \"S,\" as you know, addresses sensitivity to market risk and reflects in large part a bank's ability to manage that risk.  Any managers in the audience who are with U.S. offices of foreign banks may appreciate that these rating changes simply highlight the importance of risk management that the Federal Reserve has for some time emphasized in its review of foreign banks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

The Federal Reserve has taken this process of employing new approaches to regulation a step further with its pre-commitment proposal.

The result is higher interest rate, a higher dollar, and ultimately a wider current account deficit.  If this outcome is viewed as undesirable, the way to unwind it is by lowering the deficit, accompanied by more accommodative monetary policy.  It takes two to do this tango!

In developing procedures to implement those provisions, the Federal Reserve, working with the banking industry, created a means to process returned checks on high speed equipment, which shortened return times by reducing the number of banks that might handle dishonored checks.  More recently, in 1994, the Board modified Regulation CC to implement the same-day settlement rule, which broadened banks' ability to present checks to collecting banks directly and receive same-day funds in settlement.

But, upon analysis, traditional cash instruments that appear simple may have greater risk than the complex instruments that are labeled \"derivative.\"  Indeed, placing financial instruments in pigeonholes without regard to their true risks and economic functions can create disincentives for prudent risk management   often with unfortunate results.  The structured note phenomenon of 1993 and 1994 is an important example.  Many institutions shunned \"derivatives\" in favor of these seemingly low-risk securities issued by federal agencies, only to find out later that these instruments had significant price volatility from embedded options.

First, lower-than-expected overall and core inflation and continued modest pace of wage change over this year will encourage more restrained increases in wages and prices over the coming year.  Lower inflation leads to lower inflation expectations, reinforcing the prospect for low inflation ahead.  In this case, inertia is our friend and the result is a virtuous wage-price spiral, at least for a while.  Second, some of the transitory factors, especially the appreciation of the dollar and resulting decline in import prices, appear to have longer legs and are likely to contribute more toward restraint on inflation in coming quarters than earlier appeared likely.

By my reading, in the aggregate, market participants were slower on the uptake.  Thus, the policy easings of 1991 and 1992 were greeted with some skepticism as market participants apparently interpreted those actions as reflecting a lessened concern about inflation on the part of the Federal Reserve, rather than the appropriate response to a softening in aggregate demand.  The effect of those misassessments was to produce a stunning steepening of the yield curve.  The spread between long and short-term rates is often viewed as one of the most reliable cyclical indicators and a widening as a measure of the increased stimulus of monetary policy.  But I viewed the widening in this episode as evidence of the reduced effectiveness of monetary policy in an environment where actions by bond-market participants were preventing long-term interest rates from adjusting in response to the policy-induced decline in short-term rates.  At its peak in mid-1992, the long-term Treasury bond yielded 475 basis points over the three-month bill rate, about three times the average for the prior three decades.  True, as the full dimension of the effects of the credit crunch became apparent, yields fell from those heights.  But in the interim, monetary policy's intentions were blunted by the market's misreading of the economy.  This probably prolonged the need for ease and further accentuated the required easing of the federal funds rate.

Thus, market prices tend to extrapolate that changes in monetary policy cluster in the same direction.  This is a rule that works often enough, but, as a look back to 1994 and 1995 reminds us, not always.  By mid-1994, the FOMC had substantially raised its intended federal funds rate, but market prices seemed to say that enough was not enough.  The tightenings in May and August of that year, for example, were greeted by a roughly parallel shift up in money market futures rates, implying that the actions had not gotten the Federal Reserve any closer to the goal line   instead, the goal line had been pushed back.  And the Fed indeed did continue to tighten through early 1995.  But by late 1994 and early 1995, the term structure spreads in financial markets remained very wide, implying an expectation of still significant further tightening.  As a result, the restraint associated with the policy action was amplified.  In retrospect, a tighter focus on fundamentals   that policy was acting in a pre-emptive fashion to contain inflation, rather than an extrapolation of the sequence of recent policy actions   would have helped to cap the rise in longer-term yields.

However, if long-term rates move swiftly in response to correctly anticipated policy, the required rise in short-term rates will be smaller and there will be less risk of overshooting.

However, when desired clearing balances dictate short-run movements in the demand for reserves, the reserve market, and therefore the federal funds rate, may become a bit more volatile late in the trading day.  However, to the credit of my colleagues charged with determining daily open market operations and of market participants who have adjusted operations to the new environment, that volatility has been quite muted.  Still, if markets had only daily open market operations to discern the FOMC's intentions, the scope for misimpressions in this environment would be large.

Singapore, from a similar heritage, does protect property and contract rights, the crucial pillars of market efficiency, but does not have some of the other characteristics of western democracies with which we are familiar.  There are those who argue, however, that as this remarkable city-state evolves, increasing wealth will push it toward broader freedoms."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

The part played by banks in small business finance is not a new topic for the Federal Reserve.  In fact, for many years we have been devoting substantial resources to collecting and analyzing data on small business finance generally, and the credit supplied by banks in particular.  We collect data from small businesses on how they obtain financing   or in some cases fail to obtain financing   using the National Survey of Small Business Finance and the Survey of Consumer Finances.   We also gather information directly on the small business credit extended by individual commercial banks.  We have collected information on the contract terms of bank loans to both small and large businesses since 1977 through the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business.  Since 1993, the banking agencies have required all commercial banks to report their quantities of loans to businesses by size of loan on the June Call Reports.  Lastly, as part of revised Community Reinvestment Act procedures, the banking agencies have just this year begun to collect data on small business loans by local geographic area.

The data show, for example, that 85 percent of small businesses use the services of a commercial bank within 30 miles of their firm, and that small businesses typically obtain multiple different services from their local bank.

Thus, without financial intermediaries like banks it would simply be too costly for most investors to learn the information needed to provide the credit, and too costly for the small firm to issue the credit itself.  Banks, performing the classic functions of financial intermediaries, solve these problems by producing information about borrowers and monitoring them over time, by setting loan contract terms to improve borrower incentives, by renegotiating the terms if and when the borrower is in financial difficulty, and by diversifying the risks across many small business credits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

When a bank fails, the losses to society exceed the book values involved because of the loss of the value of the bank's customer  relationships.  Even if small business borrowers are able to find financing after their bank fails, it may be at a higher interest rate and with additional collateral requirements until the new bank has had a chance to learn about the borrower's condition and prospects.  When many banks fail during a crisis, this can create a credit crunch or significant reduction in the supply of credit to bank-dependent small business borrowers.  For example, research on the Great Depression suggests that the loss of bank-borrower relationships in the 1930s may have deepened and prolonged the economic downturn.  More recently, it appears that the weak capital positions of many banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, not to mention the outright failure of over 1,100 banks during this period, contributed importantly to the sharp slowdown in bank commercial lending during the early 1990s.  While the ability of small businesses to find alternative sources of funds is considerably greater today than in the 1930s, and will likely be even greater in the future than it was in the early 1990s, such arguments do reinforce the importance of the connection between macroeconomic and bank supervisory policy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

While on-going technological and institutional changes seem likely to erode the usefulness of this assumption over time, evidence continues to generally support this assumption.  As I noted earlier, small businesses typically get their loans and other financial services from a local bank.  Additional research finds that the concentration of the local banking market is a key determinant of the rates that are charged on small business loans.  For example, it is estimated that small business borrowers in the most concentrated markets pay rates about 50 to 150 basis points higher than those in the least concentrated markets.

First, a limited amount of research suggests that there is little if any effect of the current organizational complexity of U.S. banks on their treatment of  small businesses, other things equal.  In particular, banking organizations with multiple layers of management, those that operate in multiple states, those with Section 20 securities affiliates, and those with other organizational complexities tend to charge about as much for small business credit as other banks of their same size.  Second, the research  results for the consolidation of banks alone suggest that if profitable loans are dropped by the newer universal-like banks, other small banks or nonbank firms will be standing by to pick up these loans.  Finally, the additional insurance, securities underwriting, or other financial services provided by the new institutions should provide greater opportunities for small businesses to have access to these nontraditional services."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

To cite just one example, banks are prohibited from underwriting insurance, yet the writing of a put option a form of derivative activity engaged in widely by large banks is, in economic substance, a form of insurance underwriting.

These events may have served to tip the balance in favor of national banks, so to speak, in a manner that weakens banks\u0092 ability to switch federal regulators without incurring prohibitive real economic costs.  In particular, while most state-chartered banks will continue to operate on an intrastate basis in local markets, regional and nationwide banks may find that state charters are burdensome to the extent that the banks are forced to operate under varying regulatory rules and procedures across multiple states.  If that burden were to become excessive, banks with interstate operations especially interstate retail operations would likely turn to the national charter on grounds of simple expediency.  For example, I am struck by the fact that the very largest state-chartered banks among the money center institutions are without significant retail operations or without announced intentions to expand retail banking beyond their home states.  The rest of the large state-chartered banks, those with assets over $10 billion, consist mainly of lead banks in multi-bank, multi-state holding companies.

Another positive indication of the resiliency of the state charter has been the establishment of the State-Federal Working Group.  This cooperative effort involving the states, the CSBS, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC is contributing importantly to the strengthening of the supervision of state-chartered institutions through a number of initiatives, including the adoption of the State/Federal Protocol.  The Protocol and the Nationwide Supervisory Agreement of 1996 spell out the principles and specific actions that would lead to a seamless supervision and examination of interstate, state-chartered banks.  Other initiatives of the State-Federal Working Group include greater examination emphasis on bank risk management processes, a more formalized, risk-focused approach to examination, and expanded and more effective use of information technology.

Similarly, Guglielmo Marconi initially overlooked the radio's value as a public broadcast medium, instead believing its principal application would be in the transmission of point-to-point messages, such as ship-to-ship, where communication by wire was infeasible."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

This is because, in addition to their insights, at least two complementary innovations had to fall into place.  The first was further conceptual advances in contingent claims theory, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The second was several generations of advances in computer and communications technologies that were necessary to make these concepts computationally practicable."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

First, banking organizations may develop new products or innovations to exploit regulatory \"loopholes,\" or they may decline to develop new products whose likely regulatory treatments are viewed as burdensome or unclear.  Another unintended consequence is that a policy action may establish an inappropriate unofficial government standard for how certain activities should be conducted.  In contrast to government standards, which can be extremely difficult to change, when the private sector adopts a standard that subsequently becomes outmoded, market forces generally can be expected to remedy the situation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

Now, twenty years later, we know that while the ACH has been successful in some areas, it has failed to replace a substantial portion of the daily flow of paper checks in the economy.
