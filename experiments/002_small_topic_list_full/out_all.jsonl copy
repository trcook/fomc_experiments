No longer do our largest banks simply take in deposit funds and lend out the money to borrowers.  Currently, well over $200 billion in assets that, in times past, have resided on the books of banks, now are owned by remote securitization conduits sponsored by banks.  Sponsorship of securitization, which is now almost solely a large bank phenomenon, holds the potential for completely transforming the traditional paradigm of \"banking.\"  Now, loans are made directly by the conduits, or are made by the banks and then immediately sold to the conduits.  To finance the origination or purchase of the loans, a conduit issues several classes of asset-backed securities collateralized by the loans.  Most of the conduit's debt is issued to investors who require that the senior securities be highly rated, generally double-A and triple-A.  In order to achieve these ratings, the conduit obtains credit enhancements insulating the senior security holders from defaults on the underlying loans.  Generally, it is the bank sponsor that provides these credit enhancements, which can be in the form of standby letters of credit to the conduit, or via the purchase of the most junior/subordinated securities issued by the conduit.  In return for providing the credit protection, as well as the loan origination and servicing functions, the bank lays claim to all residual spreads between the yields on the loans and the interest and non-interest cost of the conduit's securities, net of any loan losses.

In this approach, banks can choose their own capital allocations, but would be sanctioned heavily if cumulative trading losses during a quarter were to exceed their chosen capital allocations.  These new and innovative methods for treating the age-old problem of capital adequacy are likely to be followed by an unending, evolutionary flow of improvements in the prudential supervisory process.  As the industry makes technological advances in risk measurement, these advances will become imbedded in the supervisory process.  For example, the banking agencies have announced programs to place an increased emphasis on banks' internal risk measurement and management processes within the assessment of overall management quality that is, how well a bank employs modern technology to manage risk will be reflected in the \"M\" portion of the bank's CAMEL rating.

The question is what?  We cannot hope to grow our way out of the problem.  An immediate and sustained increase in annual productivity growth of about 2 percentage points apparently would be needed to close the long-run funding gap without an increase in taxes or a cut in benefits.  The improvement in productivity growth must be this large because higher productivity raises future benefits as well as current and future tax receipts. However, given that we struggle to devise economic policies that might raise productivity growth by a few tenths of a percentage point per annum, a gain of 2 full points seems beyond the reach of credibility."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

Simply put, unless social security taxes increase, or as I just indicated, more likely, benefits are adjusted, domestic savings must increase. Potential beneficiaries must further abstain from consuming all of their incomes.  Enough must be set aside over a lifetime of work to fund the excess of consumption over any non-social security income a retiree may still enjoy.  At the simplest level, one could envision households saving by actually storing goods purchased during their working years for consumption during retirement.  Even better, the resources that would have otherwise gone into the stored goods could be diverted to the production of new capital assets, which would, cumulatively, over a working lifetime, produce an even greater quantity of retirement goods and services.  In short, we would be getting more output per worker, our traditional measure of productivity, and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

As I argued at length in the Social Security Commission deliberations of 1983, with only marginal effect, some delaying of the age of eligibility for retirement benefits will become increasingly pressing.  For example, adjusting the full-benefits retirement age to keep pace with increases in life expectancy would keep the ratio of retirement years to expected lifespan approximately constant and would help to significantly narrow the funding gap. Hopefully, other modifications to social security benefits also will be judged as necessary.  Moreover, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the Consumer Price Index overstates increases in the cost of living, and thus indexing social security benefits to the CPI goes far beyond the intent of the Congress to insulate retirees from inflation.  In that regard, the recently released report from the Boskin commission makes a valuable contribution to the emerging consensus on this issue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

This reduced the reserve base and the ability of the fledgling American banking system to expand credit.

In the small-value sector, ACH payments have also grown rapidly, although from a very low base.  An important issue is how fast electronic payments will grow in the near-to-medium term and whether they will begin to replace the check as one of the major payment instruments in the retail sector.

These characteristics greatly speed up the final transfer of funds and the successful completion of settlement.  The result is that the duration of interbank risk exposures, typically overnight exposures in check clearinghouses, is shortened significantly.  Over the past few years, these risk reduction benefits have helped increase interest in the Federal Reserve's national same-day settlement service."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.

First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees.

Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary for us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers.  It is also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net is that it creates or augments incentives for some banks to take additional risks.

Research has suggested that high local market concentration leads to prices that are unfavorable to bank customers low deposit rates for retail depositors and high loan rates for small business loans.  High concentration may also lead to reduced managerial efficiency, as the price cushion provided by market power allows a \"quiet life\" for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable.

On the other hand, we must strike a balance and not make the firewalls so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergies between the banks and their affiliates.

This is why judgment has been, and will continue to be, a critical component of prudential supervision.  However, the technology and techniques banks have developed, and are developing, allow us greatly to improve that judgment by constructing measures of soundness in probability terms.  If we can obtain reasonable estimates of portfolio loss distributions, soundness can be defined, for example, as the probability of losses exceeding capital.  In other words, soundness can be defined in terms of a quantifiable insolvency probability.  Moreover, one can conceive of definitions of soundness that go beyond simply the probability of insolvency to encompass also the level and variability of losses to a deposit insurance fund in the event of insolvency.  All of these approaches, however, require the regulators to establish targets regarding acceptable failure rates or an insurance fund's exposure to potential losses.

Today many currency trades settle on day T + 2, that is, trade date plus two business days.  In part, the two days needed for settlement result from activities taking place across different time zones. However, the two days also allow extra time for back office and correspondent banking functions to be completed.  New trading arrangements, such as electronic brokerage, along with new clearing arrangements, may well cut short some of these requirements and allow changes in long-standing clearing conventions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On a single line, write a comma-separated list of 5 keywords that describe this statement.
